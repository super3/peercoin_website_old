				<h1>Peercoin Pool Mining Guide</h1>
				<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-lg-6">
				<p>
					Peercoin is a hybrid Proof-Of-Work / Proof-Of-Stake coin, with the same work algorithm as Bitcoin. This means you can mine with GPUs, FGPAs and ASICs using bitcoin mining software. With the increasing popularity of Peercoin, the slow switch to minting blocks, and the decreasing return on mining, competition for blocks becomes more fierce.

				<p>
					Even with powerful hardware it is difficult to mine alone.	Mining pools combine the power of all participants to find blocks, and share the reward based on shares. This guide shows you how to poolmine at one of the largest PPC pools.
