        <h3> Introduction</h3>

		<p>Peercoin is a hybrid Proof-Of-Work / Proof-Of-Stake coin, with the same work algorithm as Bitcoin. This means you can mine with GPU's, FGPA's and ASICs using bitcoin mining software.
		With the increasing popularity of Peercoin, the slow switch to minting blocks, and the decreasing return on mining, competition for blocks becomes more fierce. Even with powerful hardware it 
		is difficult to mine alone.	Mining pools combine the power of all participants to find block, and share the reward based on shares. This guide shows you how to poolmine at one of the largest PPC pools.</p>
		
        <h3> Step #1: Setup the PPC wallet</h3>

		<p>Download the Peercoin-QT wallet if you did not do this already. 
		Install, let it sync, and secure the wallet with a good password. 
		You can find your wallet address on the receive tab.</p>

        <ul class="clients list-inline" style="text-align:center; padding-top: 20px;">
			<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ppcoin/files/" style="color:white;"> Download</a></li>
        </ul>
		
		<h3> Step #2: Sign Up </h3>
		
		<p>Go over to the pool website: https://ppcoin.d7.lt and sign up </p>

		<p>Download the zip file, and save it to C:/Peercoin. If the file downloaded without a .zip extension, rename it and add .zip to the end of the filename.
		Extract the archive and open the folder "ppc". </p>
		
		<h3> Step #3:  Set-up the Miner</h3>
		
		<p>For the first worker, there is no set-up needed! Just double click start.bat and you should see this </p>

		<p>Now to add another worker, create a worker on the pool website and remember the details. Right click the start.bat file and click edit, press ok on the dialog.
		Now edit the text behind the  -u  (see [3]) and  -p (see [4]) flags to the settings of the new worker. <br> Save, hit start.bat and you are mining! <br>You can
		see your results on the first page, see image one!</p>
		
		Happy mining!
