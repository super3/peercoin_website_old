### Issues
Content requests, bugs, etc. are all handled through [Github Issues](https://github.com/super3/Peercoin.net/issues). We will try to get to your issue as soon as possible.

### Pull Requests
If you have a simple change to the website, we ask that you put in a pull request instead of an issue. These include things like link changes, text errors, etc. We can add these to the live site with the push of a button, which makes everything easier. 

### How to do a Pull Request
1. Click on the button in the top right that says 'Fork'.
2. This will create a copy of this repository that you can edit freely. 
3. You probably want to click on 'index.html' which contains all the text and links for the current website.
4. On that page click the 'Edit' button on the top of the code.
5. This will open the Github online editor, even if you don't know HTML you should be able to `CTRL+F` and find the text or link you are looking for. 
6. Make your changes and then click the 'Commit Changes' green button at the bottom. Be sure to include a relevant summary in the 'Commit Summary' field. 
7. On your forked repo you can now hit the green 'Compare and Review' button. It's at the top of the page, next to where it says something like 'branch: master'. 
8. From there you can submit a pull request, and we will review it ASAP.
