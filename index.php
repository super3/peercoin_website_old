				        <p>Peercoin's original and noteworthy innovation is the proof-of-stake/proof-of-work hybrid system.
<br/><br/>
Like other cryptocurrencies, initial coins can be mined through the more commonly used proof-of-work hashing process. However unlike other coins, as the hashing difficulty increases over time, users continue to be rewarded with coins generated by the additional proof-of-stake algorithim. Anyone holding 1% of the currency will be compensated with 1% of all proof-of-stake coin blocks.
<br/><br/>
In addition to increased security and improved energy efficiency, the hybrid proof-of-work+proof-of-stake algorithm combats the deflationary tendencies that cryptocurrencies can suffer because of their hard mintage caps.</p>

				        <p>Generating blocks through the hybrid proof-of-work+proof-of-stake algorithm reduces the risk of the Selfish-Miner Cornell Flaw, ">50%" attacks, and the block bloating that have been used to exploit other currencies.
<br/><br/>
The proof-of-stake portion of the algorithm stands at the heart of this security because it drastically raises the cost of an attack. Acquiring 51% of all existing coins requires more effort and resources than acquiring 51% of all mining power. Further, in a ">50%" stake attack, the attacker's investment will be, by definition, at risk of great loss because the attacker will be holding a majority of the coins that he or she is attacking. This risk of loss reduces the incentive to attempt such an attack in the first place.
<br/><br/>
Peercoin also employs other advanced security features including enforcing transaction fees at protocol level to defend against block bloating attacks.</p>

				        <p>&quot;Checkpoints are like an alert message, clients listen to them but does not enforce the checkpoint by default. Users have the choice to enable the enforcement of checkpoint, but it’s a conscious choice users must take. This means the developer responsible for the checkpoint must gain community consensus before using them, developer cannot arbitrarily force a block chain reorganization onto the users. Generally speaking the checkpoint feature should not be used without 51% attack emergency.
						<br/><br/>
						The risk of 51% denial-of-service attack on block chain is real, especially to a smaller network. In fact I wouldn’t exclude such a possibility to even bitcoin. Of course such an attack on bitcoin would likely not come from an individual due to the resource required. But it’s irresponsible to say that’s not possible. Just imagine what would happen if bitcoin stops processing transactions for a few days. The advanced checkpoint feature in xpm is specifically designed to deal with this situation. Yes the network would turn into quasi centralized mode by community consensus, however that’s obviously a lot better than admitting defeat and giving up.&quot; - Sunny King
						<br/><br/>
						Futhermore, Bitcoin(<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/checkpoints.cpp">see source</a>) and Litecoin(<a href="https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master-0.8/src/checkpoints.cpp">see source</a>)
						also have checkpoints in their code.

				        Nope. If Peercoin grows rapidly, stake minting may temporarily decrease as coin days are lost when trading, this would cause Peercoin to become deflationary. The flat nature of the transaction fees is intended to counter this by decreasing total transaction volume. Proponents of Peercoin argue that this will decrease deflation.
				        <br/><br/>
				        Furthermore, Bitcoin currently experiences <a href="http://letstalkbitcoin.com/is-bitcoin-overpaying-for-false-security/">a ~10%</a> inflation per year as it approaches it's total supply of 21 million. It is <b>hoped</b>
				        that when the total supply is reached that the transactions fees will be enough to sustain a secure network.
				        <br/><br/>
				        To maintain a secure network in the future, Peercoin has a 1% a year inflation (Proof-of-stake reward) to make sure there will be a secure network, no matter the transaction fees. As stated before this may become deflationary, as Bitcoin aims to be, during high volumes of transactions.
